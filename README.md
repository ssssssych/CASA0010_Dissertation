# The Prediction of Building Energy Consumption Using Machine Learning Approaches: A Case Study of New York

To carry out the analysis, run the following files in order: 

1_Data_cleaning.ipynb - This file carries out the initial data cleaning of the PLUTO and LL84 data file

2_Data_integration.ipynb - Spatail join with ACS data file at NTA level

3_Analysis_of_the_collected_data.ipynb - Check if it follows a normal distribution, if the variable needs logarithmic transformation

4_Predictive_Models.ipynb - Prediction models based on building, economic and socio-demographic factors

5_Predictive_Model_with_built_environment_only_.ipynb - Prediction models based on physical building characteristics only

6_Energy_mapping - GIS energy mapping via QGIS version 3.28.7 (long term release)
